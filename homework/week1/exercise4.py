push: updates the remote branch with local commits. 
It is one of the four commands in Git that prompts interaction with the remote repository. 
You can also think of git push as update or publish.
commit: creates a commit, which is like a snapshot of your repository. 
These commits are snapshots of your entire repository at specific times. 
Commits are the building blocks of "save points" within Git's version control.
pull: updates your current local working branch, and all of the remote tracking branches. 
It's a good idea to run git pull regularly on the branches you are working on locally.
